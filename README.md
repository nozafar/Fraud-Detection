A credit card fraud detection system using the **Isolation Forest** algorithm to detect anomalies in transactions.  
Built with Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **unsupervised anomaly detection** to find fraudulent credit card transactions.  
The algorithm isolates anomalies by randomly selecting features and split values — anomalies require fewer splits to isolate.

**Highlights:**
- Uses `IsolationForest` from scikit-learn.
- Works with highly imbalanced datasets.
- Evaluates with precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Simple, lightweight, and easy to deploy.

## 📊 Dataset
We use the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud),  
containing **284,807 transactions** and **492 fraud cases** (~0.172% fraud rate).

---

## 🚀 Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nozafar/Fraud-Detection.git
cd Fraud-Detection
````

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

3. **Add dataset**
   Place `creditcard.csv` in the project directory.

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the detection script:

```bash
python fraud_detection.py
```

**Example output:**

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
           0     0.999     0.999     0.999    56864
           1     0.850     0.780     0.814      103
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Load data** from CSV.
2. **Split data** into training and testing sets.
3. **Train Isolation Forest** with contamination rate matching fraud rate.
4. **Predict anomalies** on test set.
5. **Evaluate** using `classification_report`.

---

## 📈 Model Performance

* **High precision** means fewer false alarms.
* **Good recall** ensures more fraud cases are caught.
* F1-score balances both.
